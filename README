# Chartbot: A Full-Duplex Voice Conversational AI

This project is an advanced, voice-first chatbot that leverages multiple AI services to provide a fluid, real-time conversational experience. It has been updated from a simple text-based prototype to a full-duplex voice interface.

## Core Technologies
- **LLM Backend:** [Groq](https://groq.com/) for fast language model responses.
- **Speech-to-Text (STT):** [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/) for real-time, streaming transcription.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Supports both Groq and Deepgram for AI-generated voices, with a fallback to the browser's native `SpeechSynthesis` API.

## Key Features
- **Full-Duplex Voice Mode:** Engage in a natural back-and-forth conversation. The application automatically manages turn-taking, switching between listening and speaking.
- **Interrupt-to-Speak:** Users can interrupt the AI's response at any time simply by starting to speak, just like in a human conversation.
- **Dedicated Call UI:** A sleek, modern overlay replaces the main chat interface during a call. It features a minimalist design with a top bar for controls, a central stage for the AI avatar and user's voice waveform, and a live transcript of the most recent messages.
- **Real-time Visual Feedback:** The UI provides rich visual feedback. The AI avatar glows when speaking, and a real-time waveform visualizer animates based on the user's microphone input.
- **In-Call Controls:** Users can end the call or toggle between high-quality AI voices and a generic browser voice directly from the call interface. A call duration timer is also displayed.
- **Transcript Synchronization:** The full conversation from a voice call, including the snippets shown in the live transcript, is seamlessly rendered into the main chat window after the call ends.
- **Robust Error Handling:** The application includes pre-flight checks for microphone availability and permissions, and features a fallback mechanism for TTS services.

## Usage
