# Chartbot: A Full-Duplex Voice Conversational AI

This project is an advanced, voice-first chatbot that leverages multiple AI services to provide a fluid, real-time conversational experience. It has been updated from a simple text-based prototype to a full-duplex voice interface.

## Core Technologies
- **LLM Backend:** [Groq](https://groq.com/) for fast language model responses.
- **Speech-to-Text (STT):** [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/) for real-time, streaming transcription.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Supports both Groq and Deepgram for AI-generated voices, with a fallback to the browser's native `SpeechSynthesis` API.

## Key Features
- **Full-Duplex Voice Mode:** Engage in a natural back-and-forth conversation. The application automatically manages turn-taking, switching between listening and speaking.
- **Interrupt-to-Speak:** Users can interrupt the AI's response at any time simply by starting to speak, just like in a human conversation.
- **Dedicated Call UI:** A clean, focused overlay appears during the voice call, showing connection and speech status.
- **Real-time UI Feedback:** The UI provides instant visual cues for microphone status (connecting, listening, errors) and AI activity.
- **Transcript Synchronization:** The full conversation from a voice call is rendered into the main chat window after the call ends, preserving the interaction history.
- **Robust Error Handling:** The application includes pre-flight checks for microphone availability and permissions, and features a fallback mechanism for TTS services.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
2. Enter your Groq and Deepgram API keys in the settings menu (â˜°).
3. Click the microphone button (ðŸŽ¤) to start a voice conversation.
4. Click the microphone button again or the "End Call" button to terminate the call.
